| Oct 14 |     5pm-6pm     | I think a simple way to start this for V1 would be to think about coding this problem to use simple loops and substring checks. You would start by looping through each position in the DNA sequence, and at every position, you’d check if the STR begins there by comparing a substring of the sequence to the STR. If it matches, you then keep moving forward by the length of the STR and continue counting how many times in a row it repeats. Once the streak ends, you record that count and compare it to the maximum streak you’ve found so far. If it’s larger, you update your maximum. Then you continue scanning the sequence from the next position until the entire DNA sequence has been checked. By the end, you’ll have stored the highest repeat count of the STR anywhere in the sequence. |

When I started ipmlemementing this, the first challenge was figuring out how to check for repeats without getting lost in the long DNA string. I set up a loop to go through each position, and at first I kept forgetting to reset the counter after a streak ended, which gave me wrong answers. Once I fixed that, I realized I also needed to move forward by the length of the STR during a streak so overlapping parts wouldn't count. It took a bit of trial and error but passed all checks at the end! |

I believe the current run time would be O(sequence length * str length), so I want to try to optimize this somehow. I think one way to help would be to check to see if the first letter of the given substring matches the first letter of str. If I see immediately that they aren't equal, I could move on to the next part without checking. I implemented that and it minorly improved the runtime but definitely did not make a categorical improvement. I am excited to learn about the better way to solve this because I really struggled to think of something different that works. |

I studied the slides that were posted and started to understand Horner's method as well as the Rabin-Karp fingerprinting algorithm. I think that I am going to have a hash function which gets the initial hash, and then I am also going to create a slide function which will use the previous hash in order to get the new hash. Also, I am still thinking about whether you want to skip past the length of STR when you get a math or if you want to slide your way over. My guess is that skipping will be faster but I am going to try to implement both. |

However, I did not put any %s in because the radix is so small that I don't think I will need it. At the end if I have time, I am going to generalize to 256, in which case I would need the %s. This is ebcause the hash values could grow to be much much larger, so I need to prevent overflow through the modulus function and a large prime number to prevent overflow. |

I think that my hashing functions work well, so now I need to find a way to actually index through the sequence and compare the hashes. Also, I am worried about the edge case that may appear when letters overlap because I honestly have zero clue how to solve that. |
