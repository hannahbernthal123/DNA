| Oct 14 | 5pm-6pm | I think a simple way to start this for V1 would be to think about coding this problem to use simple loops and substring checks. You would start by looping through each position in the DNA sequence, and at every position, you’d check if the STR begins there by comparing a substring of the sequence to the STR. If it matches, you then keep moving forward by the length of the STR and continue counting how many times in a row it repeats. Once the streak ends, you record that count and compare it to the maximum streak you’ve found so far. If it’s larger, you update your maximum. Then you continue scanning the sequence from the next position until the entire DNA sequence has been checked. By the end, you’ll have stored the highest repeat count of the STR anywhere in the sequence.|
